# DISCONTINUED
The Lemmy team is now officially releasing ARM64 builds for docker. You should use those instead.

# Lemmy ARM64 Images

[hub.docker.com/r/modeh93/lemmy/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/modeh93/lemmy/tags)

This is mostly for personal use. You're free to use the created images if you want, but I can't promise timely updates, bug fixes, vulnerability fixes, etc. I'll try to keep this up-to-date for as long as I'm using lemmy.

If lemmy starts releasing official ARM64 images again, you should use those instead.

# Build Time

Duration in seconds for step 6 (build).
